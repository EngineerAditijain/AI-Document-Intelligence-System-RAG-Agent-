THINK STRAIGHT: CORE PRINCIPLES (Darius Foroux)

1. YOU BECOME WHAT YOU THINK
- Your mind is a tool, not your master.
- Change your thoughts, change your life.
- Focus on what you can control.

2. OVERTHINKING IS NOT THINKING
- Thinking brings clarity; overthinking brings chaos.
- If you're stressed, you're not thinking, you're worrying.
- Make decisions quickly; change them slowly.

3. USE WHAT WORKS (PRAGMATISM)
- Don't get caught up in theory.
- Focus on practical, actionable steps.
- If a method works, use it.

4. CONTROL YOUR MIND
- Train your brain to stop ruminating.
- Replace negative thoughts with constructive ones.
- Release your mind from the past and future.

5. LOOK AT FACTS
- Differentiate between reality and your perceptions.
- Ask: "Is this thought objectively true?"
- Base decisions on evidence, not emotions.

6. TAKE TIME TO THINK
- Set aside dedicated time to reflect.
- Silence the noise to hear your own voice.
- Do not let distractions ruin your focus.

7. SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE
- Reduce the amount of input (news, social media).
- Focus on your top priorities.
- A clear mind is a powerful mind.

8. TAKE ACTION
- Thoughts without action are useless.
- "Actionable Thinking" is the goal.
- Turn ideas into, small, manageable steps.
